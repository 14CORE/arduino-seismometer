Part of an old project of mine to read and display adx345 accelerometer readings
on display.

The idea was to use Arduino and adx345 accelerometer (from Sparkfun) to measure
seismic activity. On bigger change it would send a signal to webcam and record 
what is going on outside the window.

I was making it because we have a problem in Riga, Latvia. Because of too bad 
roads and too heavy vehicles in downtown using them, we get something 
similar to small earthquakes. This causes damage houses by creating cracks in the 
walls and ceiling. I wanted to record these causes on 'tape', get the vibration 
strength equivalent in Richter magnitude scale and send it to the authority or 
media to see if something could be done to fix that (make them fix the roads).

The project was unfinished because I moved to a new place and had no need for it 
anymore.

Check the screenshots folder to get an understanding how far I got with it.
